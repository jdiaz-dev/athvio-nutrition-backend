“The most expensive mistake a CTO can make in a tech company”

Thinking “the team already understands the business.

They don’t.
And that misunderstanding is costing millions.

When business speaks one language
and engineering speaks another,
your software becomes a broken translator.

That’s when the chaos starts:

- Features nobody uses
- Months of wasted development
- Conflicting rules implemented across services
- Bugs that keep coming back
- Teams arguing instead of shipping
- Customers confused and frustrated

The fix is not better documentation or more meetings

It’s Domain Driven Design (DDD).

When a CTO adopts DDD:

- Everyone speaks the same ubiquitous language
- Core domains become crystal clear
- Rules live in the model, not in people’s heads
- Teams deliver faster with fewer mistakes

Tech doesn’t scale because of microservices or cloud.
It scales when business and engineering finally speak the same language.
