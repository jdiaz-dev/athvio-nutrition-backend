# Anticancer mechanisms - concepts 
## Inhibit Tumor Cell Proliferation
- Meaning: Prevents cancer cells from multiplying and forming new cells.
- Mechanism: Targets the cell cycle to stop uncontrolled division of cancer cells.
Goal: Stop tumor from growing bigger.

## Induce Apoptosis
- Meaning: Triggers programmed cell death in cancer cells.
- Mechanism: Activates internal or external cell death pathways
Goal: Kill cancer cells directly.

## Inhibit Angiogenesis
- Meaning: Prevents the formation of new blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen to tumors.
- Mechanism: Blocks angiogenic signals like VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor).
Goal: Starve the tumor by cutting its blood supply.

## Inflamation and cancer 
- The relationship between cancer and inflammation is bidirectional
- Inflammation can initiate, promote, and sustain cancer development — and cancer can trigger chronic inflammation.

## Oxidation and cancer
* Oxidation refers to a chemical reaction where a molecule loses electrons, often producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as:
- Superoxide anion (O₂⁻)
- Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)
- Hydroxyl radical (•OH)

* How Oxidative Stress Promotes Cancer
1. DNA Damage
- ROS can cause mutations by damaging bases or breaking DNA strands.
- This leads to genomic instability, one of the hallmarks of cancer.

2. Chronic Inflammation
- ROS can activate inflammatory pathways (like NF-κB).
- Chronic inflammation fuels proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune evasion.

3. Increased Cell Proliferation
- Oxidative stress activates signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK, PI3K/AKT) that promote cell division.
4. Inhibition of Apoptosis
- Cancer cells often adapt to oxidative stress by suppressing programmed cell death, allowing them to survive longer.

## question 
- how to works one anti-inflamatory effect
- how to works selective toxicity
