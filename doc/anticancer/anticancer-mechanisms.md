# Anticancer mechanisms - concepts 
## Inhibit Tumor Cell Proliferation
- Meaning: Prevents cancer cells from multiplying and forming new cells.
- Mechanism: Targets the cell cycle to stop uncontrolled division of cancer cells.
Goal: Stop tumor from growing bigger.

## Induce Apoptosis
- Meaning: Triggers programmed cell death in cancer cells.
- Mechanism: Activates internal or external cell death pathways
Goal: Kill cancer cells directly.

## Inhibit Angiogenesis
- Meaning: Prevents the formation of new blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen to tumors.
- Mechanism: Blocks angiogenic signals like VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor).
Goal: Starve the tumor by cutting its blood supply.

## Inflamation and cancer 
- The relationship between cancer and inflammation is bidirectional
- Inflammation can initiate, promote, and sustain cancer development — and cancer can trigger chronic inflammation.

## Oxidation and cancer
* Oxidation refers to a chemical reaction where a molecule loses electrons, often producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as:
- Superoxide anion (O₂⁻)
- Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)
- Hydroxyl radical (•OH)

* How Oxidative Stress Promotes Cancer
1. DNA Damage
- ROS can cause mutations by damaging bases or breaking DNA strands.
- This leads to genomic instability, one of the hallmarks of cancer.

2. Chronic Inflammation
- ROS can activate inflammatory pathways (like NF-κB).
- Chronic inflammation fuels proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune evasion.

3. Increased Cell Proliferation
- Oxidative stress activates signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK, PI3K/AKT) that promote cell division.
4. Inhibition of Apoptosis
- Cancer cells often adapt to oxidative stress by suppressing programmed cell death, allowing them to survive longer.

## Disrupt cancer cell membranes
- "Disrupt cancer cell membranes" means that saponins physically or chemically interfere with the structure and integrity of the outer layer (membrane) of cancer cells, causing damage or death.

## Signaling pathways
- In biology, signaling pathways are a series of molecular events inside a cell that are triggered by signals from outside the cell — like hormones, growth factors, or nutrients — and lead to a specific response. These responses can include:
    - cell growth or division
    - cell death (apoptosis)
    - inflammation
    - movement
    - production of proteins
    - and many others.

### In cancer context:
- Cancer often arises when signaling pathways that control cell growth, division, or death are disrupted. Some of the most well-known cancer-related pathways include:
| Pathway           | Role                    | Cancer Connection                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **PI3K/Akt/mTOR** | Cell growth & survival  | Often overactive in many cancers               |
| **MAPK/ERK**      | Cell division & growth  | Frequently mutated in tumors                   |
| **Wnt/β-catenin** | Cell proliferation      | Implicated in colon and other cancers          |
| **NF-κB**         | Inflammation & survival | Promotes cancer cell resistance to death       |
| **p53**           | DNA repair & apoptosis  | Mutated in \~50% of cancers (tumor suppressor) |


## question 
- how to works one anti-inflamatory effect
- how to works selective toxicity
- saponina is one antinutrient
