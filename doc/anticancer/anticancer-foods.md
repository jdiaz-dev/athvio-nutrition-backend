# Honey
1. Rich in Polyphenols and Flavonoids:
Honey contains compounds like quercetin, kaemp  rol, chrysin, and galangin — 
all known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. These compounds can:
- Inhibit tumor cell proliferation
- Induce apoptosis 
- Inhibit angiogenesis 

# Apples
- Quercetin (a flavonoid) - Induces apoptosis
- Catechin
- Chlorogenic Acid - Reduces oxidative damage and modulates gene expression related to inflammation and cancer.
- Pectin - Promotes healthy gut microbiota and produces butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid with anti-cancer effects in the colon.
- Anthocyanins  (in red apples) - Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and may reduce cancer cell invasion and metastasis

# Banana
- Banana Lectin - inhibit cancer cell growth and trigger immune responses.
- Ferulic acid - Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, apoptosis inducer
- Gallic acid - Antiproliferative, pro-apoptotic
- Catechins - Antioxidant, inhibit angiogenesis
- Chlorogenic acid - DNA protection, ROS scavenging

# Oats
- Avenanthramides (AVAs)
    - Avenanthramides are a unique group of phenolic compounds found almost exclusively in oats
    - Potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents.
    - inhibit proliferation
    - inducing apoptosis and reducing oxidative stress
- β-Glucans (soluble fibers) 
    - Boost immune function (macrophage and NK cell activation).
    - May reduce tumor growth by enhancing the body’s immune surveillance.
    - Also linked to lowering systemic inflammation—a cancer risk factor.
- Ferulic Acid (antioxidant)
    - Oats contain ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and p-coumaric acid.
    - These polyphenols have free radical-scavenging properties and may protect cells from DNA damage.
- Saponins


# Allspice
- Eugenol - Induces apoptosis, Inhibits angiogenesis , Acts as a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.
- Gallic Acid 
    - A phenolic acid present in small amounts.
    - Promotes oxidative stress in cancer cells (selective toxicity)
    - Inhibits metastasis and tumor proliferation.
- Quercetin
    - allspice in trace amounts
    - Modulates signaling pathways like PI3K/AKT and MAPK
    - Inhibits cancer cell cycle progression.
- Tannins and Terpenes

# Quinoa
- Saponins
    - Disrupt cancer cell membranes, 
    - induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) 
    - and inhibit tumor growth.
- Polyphenols (Quercetin, kaempferol, ferulic acid, gallic acid)
    - Strong antioxidants that neutralize free radicals, 
    - inhibit inflammation, 
    - and interfere with cancer cell signaling pathways.
- Flavonoids (Quercetin & Kaempferol)
    - Inhibit cancer cell proliferation.
    - Induce apoptosis in various cancer cells.
    - Suppress angiogenesis.
- Phytosterols (Beta-sitosterol.)    
    - Inhibit tumor growth by modulating immune response and reducing inflammation.
